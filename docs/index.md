### Pay, rates & profit sharing

#### Rates

We bill our clients between £450 and £650 for each 6 hour day that we work. The rate depends on their means and our level of involvment in managing the project & infrastructure.

#### Pay

We have 3 rates of pay: members, collaborators and trainees.

Our pay is intended as fair compensation for professional services. We treat everyone as equal regardless of they type of contribution they make. We set our base rate to balance the sustainability of our business while prioritising the welfare of our workers.

Members are paid a base rate of £180 per day. This is topped up on a quarterly basis prorata for everyone regardless of which projects they have worked on. The amount we share out is 80% of profit for that quarter. The remaing 20% is put towards admin, hardship & contingency funds.

Collaborators are paid a flat rate of £200 per day if they are helping with Cookiewolf admin and £250 per day if they are working on a billable project.

Trainees are paid a minimum of £16 per hour. If they are participating as probationary members, they also receive some profit share.

All member and trainee employees get 6 weeks or prorata holiday pay.

All member and trainee employees are entitled to equipment, training and travel bursaries according to need.
