# Cookiewolf Co-operative handbook

## About Cookiewolf

Cookiewolf was formalised as a co-operative in February 2025 to realise a shared goal between us.

Weâ€™re a collective of developers, designers, researchers and other folk who understand digital tools, small organisation goals, sustainability and creative thinking. Our solutions focus on accessibility and inclusivity as well as delivering on a limited budget.

### Our values

Cookiewolf's aim is to collaborate with like-minded people working with organisations that create positive change in the world while reflecting these values ourself.

### What we do

We work with organisations and people to discover, design and build the digital tools they need.

## Working together

### Roles
We operate as flat a hierarchy. We are project managers, creatives, programmers, artists and designers.

#### Directors
Our directors are responsible for the legalities of running the buiness. They are re-elected from members once a year. They have the same power and shareholding as members who are not directors.

#### Members
Our members set the strategic direction and culture of Cookiewolf. They bring in business together and share equally in the profits. They attend regular check-ins but have no minimum commitment of work hours. They take care of internal admin and client work.

#### Collaborators
Our collaborators have no power over our strategic decisions nor our culture, but we do invite their input. They work with us on specific projects for set periods of time.
